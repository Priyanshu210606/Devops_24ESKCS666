# 🧠 What is Docker?

**Docker** is a platform used to package, distribute, and run applications inside lightweight isolated environments called **containers**.

Instead of installing an application and all its dependencies manually on every machine, Docker allows us to package them together.

# 📚 Core Docker Concepts

## 📦 Docker Image

An image is a **read-only package/template** used to create containers.

Example:

```bash
nginx:latest
node:20
mysql:8
```

---

## 🚀 Docker Container

A container is a **running instance of an image**.

```text
Docker Image
     │
     ├── Container 1
     ├── Container 2
     └── Container 3
```

One image can create multiple containers.

---

## 📝 Dockerfile

A Dockerfile contains instructions used to build a Docker image.

Example:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Dockerfile Workflow

   🌐 APPLICATION
```

### Complete Deployment Command Flow

```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --name my-app \
  my-app:1.0

docker ps

docker logs my-app

docker tag my-app:1.0 username/my-app:1.0

docker push username/my-app:1.0

docker pull username/my-app:1.0

docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --name my-app \
  username/my-app:1.0
```

---

# 🐳 Essential Docker Commands

## 🔍 Docker Information

```bash
docker --version
docker info
docker help
```

---

## 📦 Images

```bash
docker images
docker image ls
docker pull nginx
docker image inspect nginx
docker image rm IMAGE
```

---

## 🚀 Containers

```bash
docker run nginx
docker run -d nginx
docker run -d --name my-nginx nginx

docker ps
docker ps -a

docker start CONTAINER
docker stop CONTAINER
docker restart CONTAINER

docker rm CONTAINER
```

---

## 📋 Container Logs

```bash
docker logs CONTAINER

docker logs -f CONTAINER
```

---

## 🖥️ Access Container Shell

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER sh
```

---

# 🔌 Port Mapping

Docker allows applications running inside containers to be accessed from outside.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

### Meaning

```text
Host Port : Container Port

3000 : 3000
```

### Request Flow

```text
🌐 Browser
     │
     ▼
localhost:3000
     │
     ▼
Docker Port Mapping
     │
     ▼
Container:3000
     │
     ▼
Application
```

---

# 💾 Docker Volumes

Containers can be temporary. Important application data should therefore be stored using persistent storage such as Docker volumes.

### Commands

```bash
docker volume ls

docker volume create app-data

docker volume inspect app-data
```

### Mount Volume

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v app-data:/data \
  IMAGE
```

### Why Volumes?

```text
Container
   │
   ├── Application
   │
   └── /data
          │
          ▼
      💾 Volume
          │
          ▼
    Persistent Data
```

Useful for:

* 🗄️ Databases
* 📁 Uploaded files
* 💾 Application data
* 📊 Persistent state

---

# 🌐 Docker Networking

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other.

### Commands

```bash
docker network ls

docker network create app-network

docker network inspect app-network
```

### Example

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name backend \
  --network app-network \
  backend-image
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name frontend \
  --network app-network \
  frontend-image
```

### Architecture

```text
       🌐 Frontend
            │
            ▼
       🌐 Docker Network
         /           \
        ▼             ▼
   ⚙️ Backend      🗄️ Database
```

---

# ⚙️ Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to define and run **multi-container applications**.

Example architecture:

```text
             🌐 Frontend
                  │
                  ▼
             ⚙️ Backend
                  │
                  ▼
             🗄️ Database
```

Example `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: appdb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:
```

### Compose Commands

```bash
docker compose up

docker compose up -d

docker compose ps

docker compose logs

docker compose build

docker compose restart

docker compose down
```

---

# ☁️ Docker Hub & Registries

# 🔐 Docker Security

Security is an important part of container deployment.

### Best Practices

```text
🔐 Use trusted images
      ↓
🔄 Keep images updated
      ↓
👤 Avoid unnecessary root privileges
      ↓
🔑 Never hard-code secrets
      ↓
🔎 Scan images
      ↓
🌐 Expose only required ports
```

### Important Rules

* Use trusted base images.
* Keep images updated.
* Do not store passwords/API keys inside Dockerfiles.
* Avoid running applications as root when unnecessary.
* Scan images for vulnerabilities.
* Expose only required ports.
* Use secure secret/configuration management.

---

# 🛠️ Docker Troubleshooting

## Container is not running

```bash
docker ps -a
docker logs CONTAINER
```

---

## Port already in use

Change the host port:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:3000 IMAGE
```

---

## Image not found

```bash
docker images
docker pull IMAGE
```

---

## Inspect container

```bash
docker inspect CONTAINER
```

---

## Check resource usage

```bash
docker stats
```

---

## Check Docker disk usage

```bash
docker system df
```
